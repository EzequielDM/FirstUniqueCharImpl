# What is this?
This is a simple repository for a stupid simple solution to a technical interview problem presented to JovemTranquilÃ£o (a Brazilian youtuber) on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMzqdP776bM).
I was **EXTREMELY** confused by the solution presented by the YouTuber who was deeply praised on the comments so... I decided to write this in 5 minutes to check if I could provide a better solution in JAVA.
Turns out, it didn't take much.... maybe impostor syndrome is real?

## Why this is better?
Simple, it actually works. The coding solution provided on the video isn't finished because the interviewer interrupted him.
Turns out if he'd finished writing that function, it'd not return the first unique character nor would it return anything plausible without further complicating the code.
The issue is simple, he had not remembered about `LinkedHashMap` which is an ordered HashMap based on order of inputs. Normal HashMaps are "randomly" ordered based on the attributed hash.

I also splurged a bit and added unit tests for **no god damn reason at all**. Mostly to setup VSCode for JAVA on Linux for the sake of learning it as I'd never set it up on Linux before.
Turns out Linux is ONCE AGAIN easier than Windows, who could've guessed.

__cdecl > all
